*Executive Summary* \
		Indonesia is a country with the fourth largest population in the world. In 2030, Indonesia will experience a demographic bonus, where the proportion of the productive age population is the largest. This is a good thing, because the population is an important factor in development. The population structure will affect economic growth (Kurniawati and Sugiyanto, 2021). In the Solow model, economic growth is influenced by labor and capital factors. The productive age population, namely the population aged 15-64 years, is the main component of the labor factor in the Solow model. \
		Although beneficial, the rapid growth of the productive age population also creates new population problems. Plus the current economic conditions that led to an increase in inflation. Home prices can rise as much as 5 percent in a year. Some observers believe that it is increasingly difficult for young people in their productive age to buy a house (Kompas, 07/07/2022). \
		The inability to buy housing has become a major problem in major cities in the world, such as Hong Kong, London, New York, Tokyo, etc. (Databoks, 2021). The capital city of Indonesia, DKI Jakarta is the best reflection of the urgent need for housing. According to BPS, the province with the highest density in Indonesia in 2015 had a population of 10,177,921 people. After 6 years, the population will increase by around 600,000 people, reaching 10,609,681 people in 2021. When viewed from the population structure, obesity occurs in the productive age population group. The high economic activity of DKI Jakarta attracts residents from outside, especially the productive age population, to migrate to DKI Jakarta. The high population density in Jakarta has many impacts. One of them is the increasing demand for housing. \
		To overcome these problems, the government needs to continue to provide subsidized mortgages or flats according to the needs of the community. The private sector can also help build housing that accommodates the many needs of the community. Development must be carefully planned so as not to cause new problems in the future. The more people there are, the more houses are built, the less free open space is. Not to mention the potential for the emergence of slum settlements. With the current condition of Jakarta which is already crowded, then what will the conditions be during the demographic bonus in 2030? \
		Utilizing the availability of existing data and the powerfulness of machine learning, the authors try to predict and map the kelurahan with the largest housing needs based on the number of productive age population in DKI Jakarta. According to Riiman, et al (2019), the use of Artificial Neural Network models is still rarely used in predicting populations. In addition, this research will also conduct clustering in urban villages in Jakarta according to the age structure of the population, so that it is known which areas need to be prioritized in the flats program. It is hoped that this research can provide recommendations for the government and related parties for future housing development planning. 

*Quotes* \
_A step in any direction is better than a hundred times thinking about it._

*Research question* \
Based on data analysis of the population of DKI Jakarta province by age group and gender, the author tries to find answers to the following questions: 
1. What is the projection of the number of productive age population in DKI Jakarta Province? 
2. What is the clustering of urban villages in DKI Jakarta according to the age structure of the population?

*The reasons for raising the issue* \
The increasing population development may be the answer for the government to start predicting and developing housing in each area in DKI Jakarta.

*Project Scope & Deliverables* \
This study predicts the productive age population of DKI Jakarta using the years 2013-2021.
